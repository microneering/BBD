Here are notes to get a BBD loaded into a blank MySQL installation.

The 'backup bbd.sql' was created using the 
Windows MySQL administrator tool's backup option.

Use the MySQL administrator tool's restore option to read this file 
and create a demo datbases.

Log off and log on the MySQL administrator tool and all databases, uses,
and access privs should appear.

Now run the unit tests on the following projects

BBD
BBDAdmin
BBDDemoApplication
BBDJPA

If all units test pass, then you can run BBDAdmin, BBDDemoApplication, or BBDJPAAdmin programs.
