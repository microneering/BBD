Here are notes to get a BBD loaded into a blank MySQL installation.

The 'backup bbd.sql' was created using the 
Windows MySQL work bench version 8 tool's backup option.

Use the MySQL administrator tool's restore option to read this file 
and create a demo datbases.

Three users must be created with the following grants

user password   from Host
==== =======    =========
bbd  bbd            %
test test           %
Duke Java           %

These grants are required

user   db schema  grant
=====  =========  ==========
bbd    bbd        execute
bbd    persist    execute
Duke   bbd        execute
Duke   test       execute,select
test   bbd        execute
test   test       execute



Log off and log on the MySQL administrator tool and all databases, uses,
and access privs should appear.

Now run the unit tests on the following projects

BBD
BBDAdmin
BBDDemoApplication
BBDJPA

If all units test pass, then you can run BBDAdmin, BBDDemoApplication, or BBDJPAAdmin programs.
